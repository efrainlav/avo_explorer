### How to use the notebook

* the first window is a sort of file manager; click the `avo_explorer_v2.ipynb` notebook to start.
* from the menubar select _Cell/Run All_ to have everything ready to run.
* to clean up the window and make more space, select _View/Toggle Header_ and _View/Toggle Toolbar_.
* scroll down until you get to the **Interactive AVO explorer**, play with the slider to change the elastic properties of the two media and see the resulting AVO effect below.
* scroll further down to play with the **Interactive AVO classes explorer**, where you can select predefined configurations of shale/sand to simulate the four AVO classes, play with the fluid content and porosity of the sand.
* if it doesn't work for you, too bad! go to the [original github repo](https://github.com/aadm/avo_explorer) and improve it.
